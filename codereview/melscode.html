    Well first off I would like to state that Mels code organization is done very well. Everything is grouped together in smaller sections making things very easy to locate. Despite having alot going on in the game, the javascript is written concisely and seems to follow DRY very well. 

    A nice chunk of the code is objects with varying information inside them, so i will focus on the functions. 

    There are 3 main functions, one iterates through the data array (full of ojectst), one submits your answer and changes the money according to your answer, and one that seems to create the modal. 

    I would suggest breaking the functions up into smaller, more specific functions and then maybe nesting some of the functions within each  other.  Some of the functions do multiple things and was a bit hard to follow all of it. 

    Also a smaller tidbit, would to use an API (or database?, im still unsure lmao) for the questions without having to hardcode everything, but its essentially the same result anyway.

    Overall i think it was a rly good project. I was expecting more code in my head but i was surprised how concise it was.
    
    Organization 10/10, would read again.
